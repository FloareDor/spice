# spice

semantic search for your sample library. local, private, fast.

stop digging through folders. just type "warm analog pad" or "punchy kick" and find what you need. uses ai to understand the *vibe* of your sounds, not just filenames.

## features
- **semantic search**: search by vibe, instrument, or description.
- **audio similarity**: find samples that sound like your favorite snare.
- **galaxy map**: visualize your entire library in 2d. similar sounds hang out together.
- **auto-tagging**: automatically tags your samples.
- **key & bpm detection**: knows the tempo and key before you even load it.
- **drag & drop**: drag samples straight into ableton, fl studio, or whatever you use.

## quick start
1. install the stuff:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. run it:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. point it to your sample folder and let it cook.

## roadmap
- [ ] vst/au plugin version
- [ ] cloud sync (maybe?)
- [ ] cooler galaxy visualization
- [ ] optimize for potato computers
